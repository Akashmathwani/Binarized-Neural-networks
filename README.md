# Binarized Neural Netwoks(BNN) in Pytorch

Binarized Neural Networks: Training Neural Networks with Weights and Activations Constrained to +1 or âˆ’1

Recent results show that deep neural networks achieve excellent performance even when, during training, weights are quantized and projected to a binary representation.
